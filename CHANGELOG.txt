  Bug fixes:
    * Removed static variable tempDoubleArray to avoid potential race condition
    * Bugfix to length=1 case in linearizerWeight
    * Errors in Utils.java now reported to STDERR rather than generating a popup window

    * Corrected an error that may have led to a small bias in the
      distribution of alignment proposal window lengths in certain cases
